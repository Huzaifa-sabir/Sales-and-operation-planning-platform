Backend Development & Integration - 10 Step Plan
Step 1: Backend Project Setup & Environment Configuration
Initialize Python FastAPI project structure
Set up virtual environment and install dependencies (FastAPI, Motor/PyMongo, Pydantic, python-jose for JWT, passlib for password hashing, python-multipart for file uploads)
Configure MongoDB connection (local or Atlas)
Set up environment variables (.env file) for database URL, JWT secret, SMTP credentials, etc.
Create basic project structure: routers, models, services, utils, config folders
Set up CORS middleware to allow frontend (localhost:5173) to communicate
Step 2: Database Schema & Models
Create Pydantic models for all entities (User, Customer, Product, SalesHistory, SOPCycle, Forecast, etc.)
Define MongoDB collections and indexes as per MONGODB_SCHEMA.md
Create database initialization scripts
Set up database connection pooling
Create utility functions for database operations (connect, disconnect, get_database)
Add seed data scripts for initial admin user and test data
Step 3: Authentication & Authorization System
Implement JWT token generation and validation
Create password hashing utilities (bcrypt)
Build authentication endpoints: /login, /logout, /me (get current user)
Implement token refresh mechanism
Create authentication dependency for protected routes
Build role-based access control (RBAC) decorator/middleware for admin-only routes
Add login attempt tracking and account lockout after max attempts
Step 4: User Management API
Build CRUD endpoints for users (/api/v1/users)
Implement user creation with email validation and password generation
Add user update, delete, and status toggle endpoints
Create password reset functionality (generate reset token, send email)
Add user search and filtering by role/status
Implement pagination for user lists
Add validation to prevent deleting the last admin user
Step 5: Customer & Product Master Data APIs
Build Customer CRUD endpoints (/api/v1/customers)
Build Product CRUD endpoints (/api/v1/products)
Implement search, filter, and pagination for both
Add validation rules (unique customer IDs, item codes)
Create Product-Customer Matrix management (which products each customer can order)
Address client feedback: Implement logic to return only customer-specific products when filtering
Add customer-specific pricing storage and retrieval
Implement soft delete (isActive flag) instead of hard delete
Step 6: Excel Import/Export Functionality
Install openpyxl or pandas for Excel handling
Create Excel template generators for customers, products, and forecasts
Build import endpoints that accept Excel files, validate data, and bulk insert
Handle import errors gracefully (return row-by-row error reports)
Build export endpoints that generate Excel files from database data
Add data formatting for Excel (dates, currency, proper column headers)
Store uploaded files temporarily and clean up after processing
Step 7: Sales History & S&OP Cycle Management APIs
Build Sales History endpoints (GET with filters by customer, product, date range)
Implement aggregation pipelines for sales statistics and charts data
Build S&OP Cycle CRUD endpoints (/api/v1/sop/cycles)
Add cycle-specific actions: Open cycle, Close cycle (with validations)
Implement automatic 16-month planning period calculation
Create cycle status management (draft → open → closed workflow)
Add notification triggers when cycle opens/closes
Track submission statistics per cycle (how many reps submitted)
Step 8: Forecast Entry & Submission System
Build forecast endpoints: GET (retrieve existing), POST (save draft), PUT (update)
Create forecast submission endpoint with validation (mandatory 12 months check)
Address client feedback: Implement price handling - fetch customer-specific prices or allow override
Store forecast data efficiently (monthly breakdown for 16 months)
Track forecast versions (draft vs submitted)
Prevent editing after submission (or implement revision workflow)
Calculate forecast totals and statistics automatically
Link forecasts to active S&OP cycle
Add bulk forecast entry via Excel import
Step 9: Reports & Analytics System
Build report generation endpoints (/api/v1/reports/generate)
Implement each report type with MongoDB aggregation pipelines:
Sales Summary (trends, totals, breakdowns)
Forecast vs Actual (variance analysis)
Customer Performance (rankings, accuracy)
Product Analysis (volumes, profitability)
Cycle Submission Status
Gross Profit Analysis
Forecast Accuracy
Monthly Dashboard (KPIs)
Create Excel report generators with proper formatting and charts
Add PDF generation (using ReportLab or similar)
Implement report scheduling and caching for performance
Store generated reports with download links
Add Power BI data export endpoint (JSON format)
Step 10: System Settings, Notifications & Final Integration
Build settings CRUD endpoints (/api/v1/settings)
Implement email notification system using SMTP
Create notification templates (cycle opened, deadline reminder, submission received)
Add background task scheduler for:
Sending reminders X days before cycle close
Auto-closing cycles after deadline (if enabled)
Cleaning up old temporary files
Build audit logging for critical actions (user changes, forecast submissions, cycle changes)
Final Frontend Integration:
Replace all mock data with actual API calls in frontend
Test all CRUD operations end-to-end
Verify role-based access works correctly
Test file uploads/downloads
Verify email notifications are sent
Test error handling and loading states
Performance optimization (add database indexes, caching, query optimization)
Security hardening (rate limiting, input sanitization, SQL injection prevention)
Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI (auto-generated by FastAPI)
Additional Considerations Throughout:
Error handling and consistent error response format
Request validation with Pydantic models
Logging for debugging and monitoring
Unit tests for critical business logic
API versioning (/api/v1/)
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Data backup strategy
Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, production)
This approach ensures:
Authentication is done first (needed for all protected routes)
Master data (users, customers, products) before transactional data
Core S&OP functionality before advanced features
Integration happens at the end when backend is stable
Client feedback points are addressed in relevant steps
