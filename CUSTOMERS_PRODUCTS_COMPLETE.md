## 🔧 How It Works

### Current Implementation (Mock Data)
Both pages work **completely** with mock data right now:
1. **View** - See all customers/products
2. **Search** - Filter the list
3. **Add** - Create new (stored in state)
4. **Edit** - Update existing (stored in state)
5. **Delete** - Remove (from state)

### When Backend Is Connected
Just replace the mock data operations with API calls:
```typescript
// Instead of:
setCustomers([...customers, newCustomer]);

// Will be:
const created = await customersAPI.create(data);
setCustomers([...customers, created]);
```

The API functions are **already written** and ready to use!

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd D:\Heavy\sop-portal-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the Application
Visit: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Mock Login (Temporary)
Since backend isn't connected yet, edit `src/store/authStore.ts`:

```typescript
initAuth: () => {
  const mockUser = {
    _id: '1',
    username: 'admin',
    email: 'admin@example.com',
    fullName: 'Admin User',
    role: 'admin' as const,
    isActive: true,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
  set({
    user: mockUser,
    token: 'mock_token',
    isAuthenticated: true,
    isLoading: false,
  });
}
```

### 4. Test Customers Page
1. Click "Customers" in sidebar
2. See 6 customers with data
3. Search for "Patito"
4. Filter by "David Brace"
5. Click "Add Customer"
6. Fill form and submit
7. See new customer in table
8. Click Edit on any customer
9. Change details and save
10. Click Delete (with confirmation)

## 📱 Responsive Design

Both pages work perfectly on:
✅ Desktop (1920px+)
✅ Laptop (1366px+)
✅ Tablet (768px+)
✅ Mobile (375px+)

Tables scroll horizontally on small screens.

---

## 🎨 Design Consistency

Both pages follow the same pattern:
1. **Statistics Cards** at top
2. **Title** with description
3. **Search Bar** (full width)
4. **Filter Dropdowns** (inline)
5. **Action Buttons** (Add, Import, Export)
6. **Data Table** (sortable, paginated)
7. **Modal Form** (for Add/Edit)

This makes it easy to add more pages with the same structure!

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

### To Connect Backend:
1. **Build Backend API** (FastAPI + MongoDB)
2. **Update API calls** in pages:
   ```typescript
   // Replace mock operations with:
   const { data } = await customersAPI.getAll();
   setCustomers(data.data);
   ```
3. **Remove mock data** arrays
4. **Test with real database**

### To Add Excel Features:
1. **Import**: Process uploaded files on backend
2. **Export**: Generate Excel files from database
3. **Templates**: Provide downloadable templates
